About the Code Book
--------------------------

This is the code book of the 'TidyData.txt' file in the project repository. It explains the variables, the data and any transformations of the data in 'TidyData.txt', which is generated by 'run_analysis.R'.

Introduction
--------------------------
The TidyData.txt contains 180 observes of  68 variables (180 * 68), in which 68 variables = Subjects Column + Activities Column + 66 Measurements columns.

66 Measurements are the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the data source. 

Please see the "Data Sources" section for the data sources, and "Data Transformations" for the mapping of transformation from data source to TidyData.txt.


Variables List
--------------------------
The variables are listed in the following table. The Subjects and Activites variables are explained in the table, but for the 66 measurements( from [3] to [68]), please find details in  'Explanation of Measurements' below.

Explanation of Measurements
--------------------------
The 66 measurement, from variable [3] to variable [68] (see 'Variables List' for the items), are derived measurements.  Please see the "Data Sources" section for the data sources, and "Data Transformations" for the mapping of transformation from data source to TidyData.txt.

Data Sources
--------------------------
The source of TidyData.txt are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You can find a set of files which explains the source data.


Data Transformations
--------------------------
The data set TidyData.txt are derived from the data sources by the following steps:

    1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. 
	
    3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities. 
    
    4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names appropriately. The names 
    are mapped to Camel Case convertion.
       
       The measurement names are mapped to Camel Case convertion, as the following mapping definitions.
       
       1) convert prefix 't' in names to 'Time'
       
       2) convert prefix 'f' in names to 'Frequency'
       
       3) convert 'BodyBody' in names to 'Body'
       
       4) convert the abbreviations
             * 'Acc' to 'Acceleration'
             * 'Gyro' to 'Gyroscope'
             * 'Mag' to 'Magnitude'
             * 'Std' - don't convert it.
       
       5) convert to Camel  Case Naming Convertions using functions
       
       6) add prefix 'Average' to the 66 measurements names
    
    5. Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity
    and each subject, from the result data set in step 4.
    
    6. Save the tidy data set to TidyData.txt.
    
An R script file, run_analysis.R is responsible for getting the data, doing the transformations, and generate the TidyData.txt. See:

https://github.com/jbeanru/GetData_Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R
    
Please read the comments in the run_analysis.R script for details. The code comments explain every line of the code nearly, as well as the thoughts and considerations of the script logic.
