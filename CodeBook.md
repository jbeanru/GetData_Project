Data Sources
--------------------------
The source of TidyData.txt are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project:

You can find a set of files which explains the source data.


Data Transformations
--------------------------
The data set TidyData.txt are derived from the data sources by the following steps:

    1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. 
	
    3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities.
    
    4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names appropriately. 
    
    5. Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, from
    the result data set in step 4.
    
    6. Save the tidy data set to TidyData.txt.
    
An R script file, run_analysis.R is responsible for getting the data, doing the transformations, and generate the TidyData.txt. See:

https://github.com/jbeanru/GetData_Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R
    
Please read the comments in the run_analysis.R script for details. The code comments explain every line of the code nearly, as well as the thoughts and considerations of the script logic.
